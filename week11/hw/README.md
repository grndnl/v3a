# Homework 11 -- Fun with OpenAI Gym!


## Assignment
In this homework, you will be training a pole to balance on a cart.

First, review the tutorial [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)

Next, work your way through the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/9da0471a9eeb2351a488cd4b44fc6bbf/reinforcement_q_learning.ipynb). Ensure that your runtime is a GPU.

Run the notebook three more times, making a different change to the code each time. You can play with the layer sizes of the neural network, the optimizer, or any of the other parameters. Make sure that you take notes on your changes and how they affected the outcome. For example, does the model train faster? Slower? 

A screenshot of the resulting graph is helpful.

## To Turn In
1. What was the first change you made to the model, and how did it affect the outcome?
2. What was the second change you made to the model, and how did it affect the outcome?
3. What was the third change you made to the model, and how did it affect the outcome?
4. How is the Epsilon value used in the training? Why does it "decay"?
5. Explain the purpose of the Gamma (`ùõæ`) value.
