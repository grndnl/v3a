# Labs 8

This week, the labs will cover aspects of data preparation, using object detection in images as a backdrop.

### Part 1a. Videos from a stationary camera
Videos are made up of frames, and each frame is an image.  But, extracting images from frames is not completely straightforward. We will use the ffmpeg library. Please install it on the machine where you will be doing the lab.  Below, we are using Docker:

```
docker run -ti ubuntu bash
# now, run 
apt update 
apt install -y ffmpeg
```
Note, if you are using Docker, you'll want to use a volume on the host system to make it easier to see your output. This can be done by adding `-v <hostDir>:<containerDir>` (example: `sudo docker run -ti -v ~/videos-output:/var/log/video ubuntu /bin/bash` ).

Please navigate to https://www.jpjodoin.com/urbantracker/dataset.html . Download sherbrooke_video.avi. This is a 2 min and 13 second video filmed from a traffic camera located at at the Sherbrooke/Amherst intersection in Montreal. 

Create the test directories:

```
mkdir -p data/ffmpeg
mkdir -p data/ffmpeg/test1
mkdir -p data/ffmpeg/test2
mkdir -p data/ffmpeg/test3
```

If you get errors in the following steps, you can extract to data/ and change the extracted image name pattern.

The first step is to extract a single image from the video.

`ffmpeg -i sherbrooke_video.avi -frames:v 1 data/ffmpeg/test1/extracted.jpg`
the option -frames:v specifies the number of frames to extract and data/ffmpeg/test1/extracted.jpg is the output file.
When complete, browser your data directory from your workstation and open up data/ffmpeg/test1/extracted.jpg and confirm that extract.


Now you wille extract 100 images from the file using the command `ffmpeg -i sherbrooke_video.avi -frames:v 100 data/ffmpeg/test2/extract%04d.jpg`
With this command, %04d tells ffmpeg to name the extracted images with the serices with a 4 digit pattern, extract0001.jpg, extract0002.jpg, etc. Other numbers may be used, e.g. to use 2 numbers, the pattern would be %02d.


Review the images. How much did the scence change?
Now we'll adjust the frames per second used with the -r option, in this case with 1 frame per second.
`ffmpeg -i sherbrooke_video.avi -frames:v 100 -r 1 data/ffmpeg/test2/extract%04d.jpg`


What's different? What happens if you change r?
Finally, we'll extract all the images with the command `ffmpeg -i sherbrooke_video.avi data/ffmpeg/test3/extract%04d.jpg`


How long did it take?
How many images did you get?
Which is the "best" approach?

### Part 1b. Videos from a moving camera
Download a sample [video dataset](https://w251lab08.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/videos.tar) captured from one of the four user-accessible cameras (the front camera) of Dima's Tesla. A few questions to consider:
* What is the key difference between stationary and moving camera captures?
* What is the resolution?
* What is the frame rate?
* In the light of the previous exercise, what is a good way to extract frames from such a video?

### Part 2. DETR tutorial
We already introduced DETR in section 3. Take a look again at the [DETR github documentation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr)

Open up the [Object Detection with DETR Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb) and examine / click though it.  

Questions:
* What was DETR trained on?
* How many annotations in that dataset?
* How many classes?
* How long does it take to train?
* What is MAP?
* What is the IoU=0.50:0.95 of [Nvidia's SSD300](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD) recipe?


### Part 3. Training DETR on custom data
In this section, we will be following the [DETR fine tuning guide](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/DETR/Fine_tuning_DetrForObjectDetection_on_custom_dataset_(balloon).ipynb). Please follow the steps; training should take !10 minutes.  Questions:
* Which dataset are we fine tuning on?
* How many classes are in the dataset?
* How many samples?
* Which model are we finetuning?
* How long are we fine tuning for?
* what is the resulting IoU=0.50:0.95?

### Part 4. Image annotation
The landscape of image annotators continues to suffer from fragmentation, with solutions rapidly changing and no provider dominating.  For the lab, we will use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).  Please create an account and upload a few dozen images that you extracted in previous sections.  Define a few classes (e.g. 'car', 'suv', 'person', etc) and try annotating. 

Questions:
* How long does it take you to annotate 10-20 images?
* How long would it take to annotate enough images for a reasonable training of DETR?
