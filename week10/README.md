# GANs
GANs (Generative Adveserial Networks) are a special type of Deep Learning which uses two neural networks (a Generator and a Discriminator) to create an object. For example, you could train the Discriminator to recognize dogs, then the Generator will learn to create pictures of dogs.

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) from 2016 provides a description of GANs.

And [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-adversarial-network-gan-for-dummies-a-step-by-step-tutorial-fdefff170391) is a great description of the GAN architecture.
